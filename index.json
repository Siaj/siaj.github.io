My initial preparation was towards the Solutions Architect Examination but then I decided to take the Practitioner exam before that, knowing that if I passed that one, it would give me lots of confidence going in for the Solutions Architect exam.\nThe whole preparation process took roughly 7 weeks for me, and that's one thing about these certification exams, you need to take as much time as possible to prepare for them as they can be really tricky and difficult if you do not have the sufficient preparation.\nI made use of materials from the AWS certification prep website (link below), where I got the gist of what to know and some recommended material to study in order to pass the exam. Things like the exam guide and a sample question is available to give you a general idea as to what to expect. Most importantly, there are links to the whitepapers and FAQs of the necessary services you need to know.\nJust thas alone was not enough to effectively study for the exam, so I made use of some video tutorials from udemy (link below). The videos really helped me a lot, as it made going through and learning about the various services less painful - because you see someone explain and demonstrate. I went through the video tutorials twice; the first round was just watching to get a general idea of the content (more like watching a TV show) and in the second round, I made lots of notes and got my \u0026lsquo;hands dirty\u0026rsquo; by practicing along with the instructor.\nAfter feeling confident about the knowledge gained so far, I got an exam prep practice exam (also from udemy - link below) to validate my knowledge before going in for the main exam. In my opinion, these practice tests are generally difficult than the main exam but excellent in preparing you for the exam - so don't be heart broken if you fail a couple of them. They provide detailed explanations to the solutions and that again helps in clearing some doubts and solidifying your knowledge in the subject matter.\nI took the Cloud Practioner exam after this, and it was really good - it helped increase my confidence, so I booked the Solutions Architect Associate (SAA) exam for the following week and passed that one too. Currently preparing to take the Developer Associate exam sometime this month and maybe the SysOps Admin Associate some other time in the near future.\nI am hoping this would help those interested in pursuing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Exam or even the Cloud Practitioner (video below) prepare sufficiently in order to ace these exams.
